# UrsaMU

The Modern MUSH-Like Server

## What is UrsaMU?

UrsaMU is a MUSH-like server written in Typescript. It is designed to be a modern, and extensible MUSH-like server.

## What is a MUSH?

A MUSH is a text-based, multi-user, real-time virtual environment. It is a descendant of MUDs, which were the precursors to modern MMORPGs. MUSHes are designed to be highly extensible, and are often used for role-playing games, or social environments.

## What is a MUSH-like?

A MUSH-like is a server that is similar to a MUSH, but is not a MUSH. UrsaMU is a MUSH-like because it is not a MUSH, but it is similar to a MUSH.

## Starting the server

To start the server in 'production' mode, make sure you have node installed, I suggest NVM, and then from the `ursamu` folder run:

```bash
npm i -g pm2
npm i
npm run start
```

To start the server in 'development' mode, make sure you have node installed, I suggest NVM, and then from the `ursamu` folder run:

```bash
npm run dev
```
