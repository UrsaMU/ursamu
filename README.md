## Welcome to UrsaMU!

UrsaMU is an innovative, Typescript-based server, echoing the classic MUSH (Multi-User Shared Hallucination) experience with a modern twist. Designed for flexibility and extendability, it's an ideal platform for creating immersive, text-based virtual worlds.

## What's a MUSH?

MUSH, a text-driven, multi-user environment, is rooted in the legacy of MUDs (Multi-User Dungeons) - the early ancestors of today's MMORPGs. These platforms are renowned for their customizability, serving as fertile grounds for role-playing adventures and vibrant social hubs.

UrsaMU stands as a MUSH-like server - embodying the essence of MUSH but with distinct features and enhancements, offering a unique twist on traditional text-based online environments.
