# Splat

Splat allows you to set one of the available types of characters to make on the game, vampire, mortal, etc. You must set your splat before you can begin setting your stats. Once your splat is set, you'll have to `stats/reset`before you can set your splat again. Using `stats/reset` will reset your entire character sheet.

Usage: `splat [<target>=]<splat>`
