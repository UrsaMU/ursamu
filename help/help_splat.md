# Setting Your Character Type (Splat)

The `+splat` command is used to set your character's basic type. This is the
first command you should use in character creation.

## Usage

`+splat <splat>` - Sets your character type

## Important Notes

- You can only use this command once
- To change your splat, you must first use `+stats/reset`
- This command must be used before setting other character stats

## Example

```
+splat vampire
```

See 'help stats' for the next step in character creation after setting your
splat.
