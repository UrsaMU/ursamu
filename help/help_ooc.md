## Description

The OOC (Out Of Character) command is used for out-of-character communication

- `ooc Hello everyone!` - Says "Hello everyone!" in OOC
- `ooc :waves to everyone` - Poses "waves to everyone" in OOC
- `ooc ;'s hand shoots up` - Poses with no space between name and action

## Examples

```
> ooc Hello there!
<OOC> Bob says, "Hello there!"

> ooc :waves friendly
<OOC> Bob waves friendly

> ooc ;waves
<OOC> Bobwaves
```

## Notes

- OOC messages are visible to everyone in your current location
- Messages are displayed in a distinct color to differentiate them from
  in-character communication
- You must be connected to use this command
