character is taking or express emotions. Your name will be shown along with the
pose.

## Examples

Using `pose`:

```
pose waves hello to everyone.
```

Will display: `YourName waves hello to everyone.`

Using `:` (adds a space after your name):

```
:smiles warmly.
```

Will display: `YourName smiles warmly.`

Using `;` (no space after your name):

```
;'s eyes light up.
```

## Notes

- The command requires you to be connected
- Your display name (moniker) will be used if you have one set, otherwise your
  regular name will be shown
- The `:` shortcut adds a space between your name and the action
- The `;` shortcut doesn't add a space, useful for possessives
- Poses are a great way to express actions and emotions in roleplay
