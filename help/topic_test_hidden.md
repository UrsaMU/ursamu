# Test Hidden Topic

This is a test topic that demonstrates the hiding and locking features of the help system.

- Files can be hidden by adding `hidden: true` to the frontmatter
- Files can be locked to specific flags by adding `lock: FlagName` to the frontmatter
- Only users with the appropriate flags (like Wizard) can see hidden files
- The lock property determines who can view the file even when it's not hidden

This provides a way to:
1. Hide sensitive documentation from regular users
2. Lock certain topics to specific user groups
3. Maintain staff-only documentation within the help system
