The `+template` command is used to set your character's basic type. This is the
first command you should use in character creation.

`+template <template>` - Sets your character type

- You can only use this command once
- To change your template, you must first use `+stats/reset`
- This command must be used before setting other character stats
```
+template vampire
```
See 'help stats' for the next step in character creation after setting your
template.
