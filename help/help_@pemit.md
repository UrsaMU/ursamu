# @pemit

## Syntax

`@pemit <target>=<message>` - Sends a message directly to a specific player

## Description

The `@pemit` command sends a private message to a specific target. Only the
target will see this message. Unlike the page command, this message appears
without any sender information.

## Example

```
@pemit Bob=Your shoelace is untied.
```

Bob will see just the message "Your shoelace is untied." without any indication
of who sent it.

## Notes

- Requires you to be connected to use
- Only the target player will see the message
- No sender information is attached to the message
- Useful for creating special effects or giving private information to players
- Different from page in that it doesn't show who sent the message
