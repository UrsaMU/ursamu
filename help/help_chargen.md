# Character Generation

Welcome to the character generation system. This guide will help you create your character step by step.

## Character Creation Steps

1. Set your splat using `+splat` - This defines your character type
2. Set your stats using `+stat` - Define your character's attributes and abilities
3. Set specialties using `+stat` with specialty notation

For detailed information on each step, see:
- help splat - For information on setting your character type
- help stats - For details on setting stats and values
- help specialties - For information on setting specialties and powers

If you need to start over, you can use `+stats/reset` to reset all your character stats.
